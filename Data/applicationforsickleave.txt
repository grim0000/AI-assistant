Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will be unable to come to work on [start date] due to an unexpected illness. I woke up this morning feeling very unwell and decided it would be best for me to see a doctor. They have advised me to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work when I return. If there is anything urgent that needs to be done in my absence, please let me know and I will do my best to take care of it from home.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Please note that you may need to include additional information or attach a doctor's note depending on your company's policies. It is always a good idea to check with your supervisor or HR department before submitting your application.
